{{ include('/events/block.html', {text:"Do you ever suddenly zone out, day-dreaming while watching a movie, replacing yourself with one of the actors? Do you have a brilliant script, but feel bad about not making it into the film industry? If any of the above is true, HAVE NO FEAR,GRAMMARFEST IS HERE! This is the place for you! Like every year, we expect to be amazed by the talented youth of Pakistan, whose short films have never failed to astound us. Letâ€™s see if you guys can break the record by producing even more impressive 5 to 8 minutes long films!
Perhaps the most basic yet competitive category, this year we will be adding more limitations to hopefully check the quality of films received. This will in turn not only bring out better films but also make selection easier."}) }}
